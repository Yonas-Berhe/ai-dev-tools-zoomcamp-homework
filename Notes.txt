**Prompt:**
I want to build a platform for conducting online coding interviews. The system should include both a frontend and backend, along with complete OpenAPI specifications.

**Requirements:**

**General Features**

* Generate a unique interview link that can be shared with candidates.
* Allow all connected participants to collaboratively edit code within a shared code editor.
* Provide real-time synchronization so that code changes are instantly visible to all users.
* Support syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages.
* Execute code safely within the browser (sandboxed execution).

**Frontend**

* Implement using React with Vite (or vanilla JavaScript if preferred).
* Include a real-time collaborative code editor with syntax highlighting.
* Connect to the backend using websockets or another suitable real-time protocol.

**Backend**

* Implement using Express.js.
* Provide APIs (documented with OpenAPI) for session management, link generation, code execution, and collaboration.
* Support real-time communication for synchronized editing.

Please generate the full project structure, architecture, and code needed to implement this platform.
follow instruction in the agents.md file and also generate implementation plan
